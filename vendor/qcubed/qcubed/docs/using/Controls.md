#Controls
The QControl is the base class for all controls. This base class works together with the QForm class to make the system work.

QCubed currently supports controls that draw standard HTML form controls, and as of version 3.1, also supports drawing most JQuery UI controls.

For a more detailed description of each control, see the QCubed Wiki pages.
